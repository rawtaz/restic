# restic project and community spirit

## Overview

We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds
and identities. For this reason, it is very important to us that a positive and
constructive atmosphere is upheld and nourished as we interact with each other.

## Conduct and interaction

We kindly remind everyone participating in or contributing to the project to
behave nicely toward others. Please treat both individuals and other cultures,
as well as their ideas and opinions with respect, and let us all do our best to
make everyone feel welcome and appreciated in this community.

Heated debates are often the result of frustration and emotions. We ask that
you think twice before replying when tension is high, and try to understand the
other party - realize that their communication might be due to different needs,
experiences, and use cases than yours.

Personal attacks are not tolerated within the community. Please also choose your
words carefully, as social and cultural backgrounds as well as language barriers
may contribute to a discrepancy between your intention and what was interpreted.

At a time when someone fails at showing you the respect you deserve, make the
best of the situation by not returning such misbehavior. Instead, explain that
you feel offended by what they said, remind them that it's fine to disagree and
that you wish to continue the discussion in a civilized manner only, or not at
all. If the situation derails, please seek advice from the BDFL (see below).

## Governance and conflict resolution

The restic project uses a governance model commonly described as Benevolent
Dictator For Life (BDFL). The BDFL is a single individual who makes decisions
when consensus cannot be reached. The project's current BDFL is [@fd0](https://github.com/fd0).

In general, we try to reach consensus in discussions. In case this fails, the
BDFL makes a decision on how to proceed on the topic or matter being discussed.

In case of misconduct or other types of conflict, the BDFL will try their best
to understand the situation and discuss it with the involved parties before
deciding on how to resolve the conflict. Please note that severe circumstances
may result in suspension or even permanent bans.

The BDFL can be reached through the following e-mail address: governance@restic.net
